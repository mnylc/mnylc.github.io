Metropolitan New York Library Council, a non-profit organization founded in 1960 that develops, maintains, and augments essential library services throughout New York City and Westchester County, has been located in the Union Square area at 11th and Broadway since 1990. Our membership currently consists of a diverse group of over 250 libraries, archives, museums and other information organizations ranging from New York’s largest libraries to small community archives, and we are growing and expanding all the time.

Twenty-six years ago, when METRO settled into its current space, the organization had very different needs. We've responded to environmental change by designing new services over the years, but the space that enables and delivers these services is ready for growth.

The time has come for METRO to cover new ground!

We have just signed a lease on a new space on 11th Avenue and 45th street, on the west side of midtown Manhattan. We will leave our current space October 1, 2016 and expect to move our staff into the newly designed space before the new year.
