### Description###

We are seeking an enthusiastic, dedicated individual to serve as Outreach Archivist for the Greenpoint Oral History and Community Scanning Project. The Outreach Archivist will conduct six (6) community events in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn over the months of April 2018 – March 2019 to provide on-site digitization service and oral history recording for members of the community who want to share their personal artifacts and stories. The project is funded by a grant from the Greenpoint Community Environmental Fund. 

 

The Greenpoint Oral History and Community Scanning Project is part of a larger effort by Brooklyn Public Library to create a repository for the environmental history of the Greenpoint community. BPL is constructing a new Greenpoint Library and Environmental Education Center at the site of the existing branch. In addition to traditional library services the new facility will provide programs, information and collections that increase awareness and stewardship of the local environment. 

 

The Outreach Archivist will be equipped with a lightweight, urban-friendly mobile digitization/recording lab that can be taken to offsite locations to reach patrons with stories or personal collections to share that relate to Greenpoint’s environmental history. Working with local partners, the Outreach Archivist will conduct six oral history and community digitization events in Greenpoint, wherein the public will be invited to record their stories and/or scan their personal photographs, ephemera, and mementos. The Outreach Archivist will use previous BPL projects Our Streets, Our Stories and Culture in Transit as frameworks. 

                                             

The Outreach Archivist will be based out of the Brooklyn Collection at BPL’s Central Library but will work with project leads for Our Streets, Our Stories, and spend time off-site providing digitization and related services. The Outreach Archivist will be responsible for organizing the community events, recording digital audio, digitizing materials (scanning or digital photography), and creating metadata to describe the digitized materials. Documentation and assessment of the community events and budget accounting will be conducted throughout the life of the project.
