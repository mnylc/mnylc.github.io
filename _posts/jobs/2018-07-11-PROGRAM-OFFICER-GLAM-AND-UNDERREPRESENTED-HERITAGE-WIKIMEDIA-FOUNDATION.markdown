### Description###

Summary
The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF)’s Community Programs team supports a diverse international community of program leaders working with cultural heritage institutions and communities to expand the impact of Wikimedia’s projects as educational platforms. As part of this work, a significant international community of organizers develops partnerships and programs that document heritage and share the collections and expertise of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAMs) on Wikimedia projects -- a community known as the GLAM-Wiki community. The new Program Officer joins an existing team that supports, facilitates, and amplifies GLAM-Wiki and other cultural heritage work through better understanding and implementation of scalable project models, greater cross-regional and international partnerships among GLAM-Wiki volunteers, and deeper communication about GLAM-Wiki beyond the Wikimedia movement.

Supporting the Wikimedia Movement Strategic Direction’s “Knowledge Equity” emphasis, this role will support the needs of Wikimedia communities working in contexts currently not well supported by the existing GLAM-Wiki community. This work will mostly be focused on working with emerging Wikimedian communities[1], many of which are in Latin America, Africa or Asia, as well as communities everywhere working with underrepresented, marginalized, or colonized knowledge. This role will lead the production of documentation, training, and outreach to help the GLAM-wiki community overcome technical and programmatic challenges, especially in applying and understanding workflows for digitization, collecting living heritage through “Wiki Loves” type programming, and working with Commons and Wikisource to represent knowledge from those communities.  

The individual will join the Programs team at the Wikimedia Foundation and will work closely with teams across the Community Engagement Department, and with organizations and allies outside of the Wikimedia Foundation, including key partners from the GLAM sector and Wikimedia affiliates. This role will play an important part in shaping and implementing our communications strategy for those allied communities.

### Responsibilities###

Liaise with GLAM-Wiki communities to strengthen the ability for volunteer groups to support institutional collaboration, especially in emerging communities:   
 -- Consult prior and existing GLAM-Wiki community leaders to determine best ways to facilitate GLAM-Wiki projects, especially projects that support the use of digitization, Wikisource, and other Wikimedia activities.

 -- Act as point-of-contact for institutions seeking information from WMF about GLAM partnerships, and direct them to the best-positioned community leaders and organizations to support partnerships.

Help communities identify and implement best practices that facilitate growth of new GLAM-Wiki and other heritage collaborations.

 -- This role will be focused on identifying and bolstering partnership models that are suitable for emerging Wikimedia communities and that may be different from the existing GLAM-Wiki community’s focus on batch uploads to Commons and Wikidata. This will likely include tactics like digitization, transcription on WikiSource, and “Wiki Loves” style campaigns -- however, we expect there to be other tactics and approaches identified as part of supporting the communities working in this space.

Facilitate growth of international capacity within GLAM-Wiki projects and among program leaders, especially around heritage materials in the Wikimedia ecosystem:

 -- Encourage development of trainings and GLAM-Wiki community events that help program leaders learn skills for collaborating with partners using platforms like Wikisource, and Commons.

 -- Write and share documentation of tools and processes, which lead to robust and equitable practices for working with marginalized or colonized heritage.

 -- Partner closely with movement leaders in developing strategic Wikimedia outreach towards global organizations, including Creative Commons, UNESCO, and other organizations supporting the collection and dissemination of heritage.
Develop and pursue communication strategies that align Wikimedia projects with the educational missions of GLAMs by communicating Wikisource, Wikimedia Commons and other Wikimedia projects as critical platforms for cultural heritage and preservation.

Help prioritize technical support from the Foundation and amongst institutional partners to further GLAM-Wiki efforts:

 -- Supporting development of partnership models and tools in the Wikimedia ecosystem, which support improved representation of marginalized knowledge and cultures.

 -- Advise on technical projects that improve the ability for local communities to implement GLAM partnerships and support the broader adoption of Wikimedia platforms for collecting and sharing worldwide cultural heritage.


### Qualifications###

We’d like you to have these skills:

 -- Strong written and spoken English.

 -- Experience and skills working with GLAM projects that integrate programs and technology, ideally involving program leaders from the Wikimedia Community.

 -- Knowledge and experience using broad open platforms for sharing heritage collections, ideally Wikimedia projects such as Wikisource and Wikimedia Commons.

 -- Experience developing partner relationships and outreach materials, ideally for the Wikimedia community.

 -- Proficiency and ability to create communications in a wide range of formats -- this role will use communications to support relationships with partners, Wikimedia affiliates, and the Wikimedia community.

 -- Experience working with communities in Asia, Africa and/or Latin America.
Experience or skills needed to collaborate with a distributed and remote team with people of diverse skill sets and backgrounds.

And it would be even more awesome if you have:

 -- Proficiency in languages other than English, especially in one or more languages widely spoken in the regions (Latin America, Africa, Asia) where the person could be active i.e. Spanish, Portuguese, French, Arabic, Chinese, etc.

 -- Knowledge or experience with Wikidata and other linked data projects.

 -- Training or experience working with academic, reference, research, and/or cultural heritage communities in collaborative projects, especially internationally
An existing network of collaborators and contacts in international open knowledge, cultural heritage, or Wikimedia communities.

A cover letter is required. We want to hear from you about why you want to work with us at Wikimedia.
