The Librarian takes a lead role in developing workflows and procedures for ingesting metadata and associated digital objects into METRO repositories and performs a variety of administrative tasks related to ingest and partner communication.
The Digital Projects and Metadata Librarian works directly with a variety of partners on issues relating to metadata quality, mapping, ingest and harvesting. The Librarian creates and maintains transformations and mappings for partners in order to facilitate contribution of metadata to DPLA from a variety of content management systems and frameworks. The Librarian maintains data sets in METRO’s aggregation tool and ensures that records are contributed, updated and removed from the DPLA site in a timely manner.
