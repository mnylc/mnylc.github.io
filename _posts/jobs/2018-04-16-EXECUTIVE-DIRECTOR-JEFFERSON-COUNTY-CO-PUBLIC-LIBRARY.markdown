### Description###

If you can provide the vision, leadership and direction to connect, discover, and create, the seven-member Jefferson County Public Library Board of Trustees may want you as its next Executive Director. Serving the 571,711 residents (320,551 card holders) of Jefferson County through ten library locations, a service center, a robust outreach program, an annual circulation of 7.9 million, and a $41.2 million annual budget, the Library is organized as a component unit of Jefferson County Government and is supported primarily through property tax revenue. The Executive Director, through vision, care and compassion, and energy will galvanize an outstanding staff to position the Library at the forefront of library service. Key opportunities include: building on a successful 2015 mill levy campaign and its promises; directing a ten-year plan to restore and expand library staffing and facilities; to participate in collaborative community problem-solving; to continue to transform the Library to meet changing user needs; and establishing JCPL as a best in class US Library. 

Located just west of Denver and just east of the Rocky Mountains, Jefferson County is a best-kept secret. It offers something for everyone: a robust and growing economy, thriving urban areas, nationally acclaimed schools, a wealth of cultural attractions, magnificent scenery, and a near-perfect climate. Diversified geographical settings range from urban to small town to rural to vibrant mountain communities. Jefferson County residents enjoy exciting opportunities for recreation and entertainment, cheering on winning sports teams, and 300+ days of sunshine in a veritable paradise of national forests, state parks and trails.
