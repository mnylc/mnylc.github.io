### Description   

New York University Libraries is seeking a tenure-track faculty librarian to support the needs of data-intensive research and teaching across a wide range of social sciences, humanities, and sciences disciplines at NYU. This individual works as part of a team to grow and sustain a rapidly evolving set of services that supports researchers across the full data lifecycle, including data finding and access; statistical, geospatial, qualitative, and text data analysis training and consultation; and data management, preservation, and publication.  


### Responsibilities   

The Data Services Librarian plays a key role in building rich data collections for the libraries, working in close collaboration with other specialists to select, acquire, and manage tabular, text-based, and data materials to support campus research and scholarship in the social sciences and humanities. This person works in tandem with technologists, metadata architects, and developers within NYU Libraries to maintain and improve systems for description, storage, discovery, and access to tabular, spatial, and text-corpus data.

This position works to promulgate awareness of our resources and services among faculty and students through outreach activities and in partnership with other providers. The incumbent works closely with colleagues in Data Services and the Librarian for Geospatial Information Systems to deliver data-focused instruction, reference, and consultation activities. Depending upon the background of the candidate, this person may also serve as liaison librarian to one or more programs or departments at the University, selecting materials and providing services to support the research and teaching of faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students in said areas.

The Data Services Librarian participates in library-wide committees, activities, and special projects, especially those involving new technologies and data. The incumbent will develop and maintain awareness of data-centered initiatives across the sciences, attending professional meetings, workshops and conferences for training and continuing professional development. The Data Services Librarian is based in the NYU Data Services, a joint service of the NYU Libraries and NYU Research Technology. This position reports to the Head of Specialized Research Services and Data Services in the Collections and Research Services Division, and operates in close coordination with the Digital Scholarship Services and the Digital Library Technology Services group.
