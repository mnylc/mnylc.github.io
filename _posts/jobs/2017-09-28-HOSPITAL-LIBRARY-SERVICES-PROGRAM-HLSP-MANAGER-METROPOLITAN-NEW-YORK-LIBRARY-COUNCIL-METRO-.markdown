### Description###

Located in New York City, the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) is the largest of nine library councils in the state of New York, with METRO serving all of New York City and Westchester County.  METRO aims to serve as a laboratory and experimental space for our growing membership, combining new developments in librarianship with emerging technologies drawn from parallel fields.

The METRO Hospital Library Services Program (HLSP) supports the work of more than 45 hospital and medical center libraries in New York City and Westchester County.

METRO’s HLSP program requires a visionary and creative thinker to reinvent it for the changing needs of medical libraries. You will be challenged to rethink the program and to push it in new directions. You will be expected to design and pilot new, useful medical library services. Your entrepreneurial instincts will guide your ideas, knowing that METRO is uniquely positioned to offer services at scale that benefit a network of libraries rather than each individual library.
