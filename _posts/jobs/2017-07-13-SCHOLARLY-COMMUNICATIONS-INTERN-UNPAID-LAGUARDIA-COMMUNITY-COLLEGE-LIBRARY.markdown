### Description###

LaGuardia Community College’s newly-expanded Library Media Resources Center is a vibrant hub of academic activity on campus. Librarians are faculty, and we teach up to 350 bibliographic instruction sessions per semester and multiple sections of credit-bearing information literacy courses in addition to working in our areas of specialty.
 
The intern will have responsibilities related to our institutional repository, CUNY Academic Works. Intern will receive training in determining copyright and publisher requirements/restrictions for our faculty members’ previously published works. Intern will conduct outreach to faculty regarding their publications and upload works on their behalf. Intern will assist with promoting the repository and open access through writing for the Library's social media and participating in professional development/outreach events such as Open Access Week. 

This is a good opportunity for the right person to learn about institutional repositories, copyright, open access, and faculty outreach. There is also the possibility of working on the Institutional Archives area of Academic Works.
 
The intern will be working primarily with the Library's Metadata Librarian and the Instructional Technology/Systems Librarian.
