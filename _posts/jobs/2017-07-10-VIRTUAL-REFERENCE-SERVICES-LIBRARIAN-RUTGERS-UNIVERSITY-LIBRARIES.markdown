### Description###

The Rutgers University Libraries seek a collaborative, creative, and user-focused librarian to develop, coordinate, evaluate, and promote virtual reference services. This is a newly created position within the recently formed Shared User Services (SUS) unit, a dynamic and innovative team of library faculty and staff responsible for coordinating shared user services including virtual reference activities, discovery infrastructure, the Libraries website, and digital projects. Reporting to the director of Shared User Services, and working closely with library directors at Camden, New Brunswick, Newark, and Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, this position will be responsible for the provision of chat and email reference, and evolving virtual reference services for all of the Rutgers University Libraries


### Responsibilities###

The key responsibilities of the Virtual Reference Services Librarian are to:
• Coordinate, promote, and establish appropriate staffing and coverage for virtual reference services, and actively participate in all modes of scheduled reference activities (face to face, chat, and email)
• Identify underserved users, programs, and domains, and institute alternative or supplementary virtual references services to a diverse user community, including users with disabilities
• Provide support and training for staff and librarians who participate in virtual reference services, institute best practices, and develop resources for the effective delivery of virtual reference
• Conduct continuous analysis and evaluation of virtual reference services through usage and transaction data to improve services, identify underserved users, programs, and domains, respond to staffing and coverage patterns, and support local library assessments
• Investigate and initiate new modes of virtual reference services in response to changing user needs, technologies, and delivery channels

This position will collaborate with librarians and staff across multiple locations, disciplines, and functional areas of the library to deliver effective virtual reference services. This position will lead a library-wide virtual reference services committee that will inform all aspects of virtual reference: identify current issues, investigate options, recommend changes, define best practices and standards, specify resource and infrastructure needs, and establish usability and assessment protocols.

This tenure-track position is based in Alexander Library, and is a member of the Libraries Faculty, who are committed to providing effective library services to a diverse academic community. The successful candidate must demonstrate a commitment to continual professional development through scholarly research including publications, presentations, and participation and leadership in the work of relevant professional associations.


### Qualifications###

Required: Master’s degree from an ALA accredited program; significant work experience providing face to face or virtual reference services; service management and training experience; experience with virtual reference service tools and an awareness of a variety of such services; experience working with diverse populations, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and researchers, and supporting a diverse and inclusive learning and working environment; ability to work collegially in a team-oriented environment; excellent interpersonal, communication, and organization skills; eligibility to work in the United States.
