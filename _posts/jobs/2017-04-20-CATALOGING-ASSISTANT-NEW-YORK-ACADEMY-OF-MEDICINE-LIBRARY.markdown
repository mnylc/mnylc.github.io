### Company Information###

The Academy is home to one of the most significant historical libraries in medicine and public health, with internationally known collections containing many of the primary formative texts of medicine. The Library is equally renowned for its extensive journal collection, comprising long runs of medical serials from around the world, and for its ephemeral materials in health and medicine. Archival holdings document the practice of medicine in New York from the 18th century to the present, and include the records of over 35 professional medical societies.

Founded in 1847 and open to the public since 1878, the Library is dedicated to building bridges among an interdisciplinary community of scholars, educators, clinicians, and the general public. It fills a unique role in the cultural and scholarly landscape of New York City through its collections, by providing research services, classes, and tours for diverse educational and professional groups, and through its public programs and activities. The Gladys Brooks Book and Paper Conservation Laboratory was established in 1982 with a mandate to care for the Academy collections.
