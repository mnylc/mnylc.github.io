Fairfield Public Library ([http://fairfieldpubliclibrary.org/)](http://fairfieldpubliclibrary.org/)) – You Belong Here!

Reporting to a six-member Board of Trustees and the First Selectman (as Town department head), the successful candidate will serve a community of 60,000+ residents from two locations – a Main Library (renovated in 2006) - housing the Bruce S. Kershner Gallery and an innovative children’s space - and a busy, popular neighborhood Branch Library. The new Town Librarian will work with a committed staff, an energetic core of volunteers, an established Friends of the Library, and a proposed $3.6 million budget to deliver quality library services and programs. Key opportunities include building strong external partnerships with community agencies and organizations; developing alternative service models while sustaining core library services; exploring new funding streams for program development; working closely with the Town of Fairfield as a contributor and collaborator; and supporting a strong, dedicated staff committed to change and innovation.
