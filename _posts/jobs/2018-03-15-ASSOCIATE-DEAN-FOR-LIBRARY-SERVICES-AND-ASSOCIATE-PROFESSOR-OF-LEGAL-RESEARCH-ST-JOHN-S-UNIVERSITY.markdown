### Description###

ST. JOHN’S UNIVERISTY SCHOOL OF LAW invites applications for the position of Associate Dean for Library Services and Associate Professor of Legal Research, serving a faculty of 42 and approximately 800 law students. 

The Rittenberg Law Library’s primary mission is to support the curricular and scholarly activities of faculty and students at the Law School. Throughout the last 10 years, the Law Library has transitioned from a predominantly print collection to a predominantly digital collection, all while ensuring that it remains responsive to the research needs and interests of faculty and students. The Library has 4.5 professional librarians, 3 support staff, and an annual budget of $2 million. 

The Associate Dean for Library Services and Associate Professor of Legal Research is a fully engaged member of the Law School community. The Associate Dean has broad responsibility for managing all aspects of the operation of the library including: collection development and management; personnel management; supervising implementation and maintenance of library technology; advising the Dean on the library budget implementing the budget once approved; and instituting new procedures as conditions warrant. The Director is responsible, in collaboration with the Dean and faculty, for establishing and implementing both technological and traditional methods of delivery of information to support the research and other library-related needs of faculty and students. The Associate Dean also manages the physical space of the Library to preserve and enhance its central role in the life of the Law School. 

The Associate Dean participates in teaching and producing scholarship. A J.D. from an ABA-accredited law school and a graduate degree in library science (or its equivalent) from an ALA-accredited institution are required. The successful candidate should be an innovative administrator with a record of accomplishment and experience in a major university law library or with comparable experience. The successful candidate must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the scope, process, and demands of a law school library and the need to align services to changes occurring in higher education, the legal academy, the legal profession, and legal publishing. Familiarity with and interest in new technologies are essential. Salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience. 

A generous benefits package is included.  The person hired will be eligible for a long-term, presumptively renewable contract.

The School of Law is part of St. John’s University, a Catholic, Vincentian, and metropolitan institution committed to academic excellence. As an Equal Opportunity Employer, St. John’s encourages applications from women, minorities and others whose background and experience would contribute to the diversity of the Law School. 

Candidates should submit no later than May 1, 2018, a cover letter, resume, and the names and contact information for three references to the Law Library Search Committee (Professor Christopher Borgen, Chair) at lawfac@stjohns.edu.
