### Description###

Search Re-opened

The Center for Jewish History is a collaborative home to five partner institutions: the American Jewish Historical Society, American Sephardi Federation, Leo Baeck Institute, Yeshiva University Museum and YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. The Center and its five partners serve the worldwide academic communities and the general public with combined holdings of over 30,000 linear feet of archival documents, a half million books, and thousands of photographs, artifacts, paintings and textiles – the largest repository documenting the Jewish experience outside Israel.  The provision of access and preservation oriented services to the collections is core to the Center for Jewish History’s mission on behalf of researchers and the partner organizations.

The Center for Jewish History seeks a project manager for the implementation of the Ex Libris digital preservation management system, Rosetta. Implementation will include preparation for and comprehensive migration from Ex Libris digital asset management system, DigiTool, which currently holds over 3.5 million digital objects and associated metadata, totaling over 40 TB of material. Implementation will also include training partner staff on the new system, facilitating interoperability between descriptive and preservation systems, and collaboratively developing workflows to support the ongoing deposit of digitized material into the new system.

The Rosetta Implementation and Migration Manager will report to the Senior Manager for Metadata and Discovery. Metadata and Discovery Services is tasked with coordinating the interoperability and integration between Center systems that control, describe, preserve, and provide access to the rich physical and digital holdings of the five Partner institutions. The successful candidate will work closely with department members in Metadata and Discovery Services, the Center’s Information Technology Department, vendors, and stakeholders in the Center and Partner community to ensure that born-digital and digitized material will be preserved in perpetuity. The position will be a permanent addition to the department.



### Responsibilities###

*Manage short and long term benchmarks for migration and implementation of Rosetta, the Center’s new digital preservation management system.

*Serve as primary contact with Ex Libris project team to assertively communicate regarding Center preparedness and preparation for implementation, including needs, expected outcomes, limitations, and problems with Center’s Digitool dataset and entities during implementation. 

*Work in collaboration with Center Implementation Project Team and Partner Liaisons to prepare for migration from Digitool to Rosetta, including but not limited to metadata preparation for import into Aleph integrated library system; deletion or segregation of digital entities not migrating to the new system; data modeling and load analysis; and customizing transformations for migration.

*Participate in Ex Libris training and experiment using Rosetta with an eye to developing and supplementing documentation for depositing both migrated and new material into the system. After Ex Libris training is complete, train Center and relevant Partner staff on workflows for depositing new material into Rosetta’s permanent repository.

*Once successful implementation of Rosetta is complete, manage day-to-day operations of the system, including troubleshooting problems; assisting with staff questions; and continuing to improve the workflow for the deposit of material and interoperability with other Center systems.

*Participate in special projects to promote and increase access to digital material held in the Center systems and other duties commensurate with the position, including project-based work both external to Center systems and within Center subsystems.

*Stay abreast of developments and professional best practices in digital asset management, digital preservation, and related topics.
