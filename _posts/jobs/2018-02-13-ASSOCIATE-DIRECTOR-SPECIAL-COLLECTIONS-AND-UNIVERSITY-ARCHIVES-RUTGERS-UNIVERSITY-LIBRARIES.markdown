### Description###

Rutgers University Libraries seek an experienced, innovative, and technologically savvy administrator to lead Special Collections and University Archives (SCUA). Reporting to the Assistant Vice President for Information Services and Director of New Brunswick Libraries, this position provides vision, leadership, and direction for a team of professional archivists and conservation specialists, with the goal of strengthening the visibility, accessibility, and impact of Rutgers University–New Brunswick’s nationally and internationally recognized special collections and archives. The Associate Director is responsible for developing comprehensive and mission-oriented digital and collections strategies that reflect current best practices and for initiating services and programs that meet the needs of our users and stakeholders. This is a highly visible position that is actively involved—in collaboration with the Rutgers Foundation, Libraries leadership, and other external partners—in donor cultivation, fundraising, grant writing, and outreach. The Associate Director will develop a deep understanding and appreciation of SCUA’s collections and identify forward-looking and synergistic opportunities and partnerships that advance the university’s mission.

SCUA holds Rutgers University Libraries’ premier unique primary source collections. Divisions include the prestigious Sinclair New Jersey Collection, Manuscripts Collection, Rare Books Collection, University Archives Collection, and other special collections such as maps, broadsides, pictorial materials, newspapers, and ephemera. SCUA is also home to the William Eliot Griffis Collection on Meiji Japan and Japanese overseas students and the collected papers of Congressman Rush Holt, Jr., Congressman William J. Hughes, and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg. SCUA’s offices—including a busy reading room; a full-service, onsite conservation and digitization lab; and two exhibit spaces—are located in the Archibald S. Alexander Library on Rutgers–New Brunswick’s College Avenue campus.

SCUA’s collections are heavily used by Rutgers undergraduate and graduate classes, by researchers ranging from international scholars to members of the New Brunswick community, and in ongoing digitization projects at Rutgers, in the state of New Jersey, and beyond. In fiscal year 2017, the SCUA reading room had over 1,000 visitors and reference staff answered over 1,700 questions. SCUA librarians and archivists continue to build world-class collections that document all aspects of New Jersey, the history of Rutgers University, and strategic areas that support the curriculum and the university’s priorities. SCUA has an active exhibitions and public program schedule that highlights SCUA’s collections and seeks to bring new constituents into the library.
