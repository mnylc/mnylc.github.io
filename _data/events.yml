    html: '<p>Hola a todos/ Hello everyone!</p> <p>Join the Racial and Social justice
      in LIS Meetup.</p> <p>Let’s discuss professionalism in librarianship, our definitions
      for professionalism and the ways we sustain neutrality when performing it. We
      will also discuss who gets to be called and be recognized as a professional
      and why. In addition, we will be discussing how oppressive professionalism is
      to certain groups in our community.</p> <p>The intention of this meetup is to
      provide a comfortable space where we discuss our ideas of professionalism in
      librarianship.</p> <p>If you have the time, please read this blog post by Madison
      Sullivan before the meetup!<br/><a href="https://acrlog.org/2016/01/19/professionalism/"

    text: |-
      Each year, more and more scholarly works are made openly available. Indeed, with European research agencies now coordinating to require immediate open access to publications based on research they fund, predictions about the inevitability of open access may soon come true. 
      As open access becomes the norm, what decisions will scholars, libraries, and institutions make? Will we reproduce existing power structures, guaranteeing the continued dominance of high-profit publishers and flawed impact metrics? Or will we build something different — community-led publishing on community-owned infrastructure, with legal terms that protect the rights and privacy of authors and readers?
      We will explore these questions in a symposium hosted by METRO Library Council on Thursday, September 12. This event is planned in collaboration with colleagues from the City University of New York.
      We are now accepting proposals for presentations, panels, activities, and facilitated discussions relevant to these questions. Possible topics include but are not limited to:

      Scholarly start-ups, business models, and acquisitions 
      Library publishing services
      Tensions between readership data and privacy
      Investing in open publishing and/or open infrastructure
      Use and misuse of metrics in faculty evaluation
      Open advocacy inside and outside the library

      To submit a proposal, please complete this form by Thursday, August 1. We look forward to hearing from you!

      This workshop will help  library workers and educators build awareness about race, class, gender, sexuality. Participants will develop language to engage in conversations around these topics in their workplaces and communities. This workshops will help participants advocate for all people’s access to relevant materials, create meaningful programs, and enhance day-to-day library practice. Instruction will refer to prominent texts from the field of culturally relevant education -- particularly literacy education -- as well as films, elements of popular culture, and anecdotes from everyday life, libraries, and classrooms.By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

      Situate themselves within US cultural context and a local context
      Draw on daily work experiences as a mode of professional learning about cultural context
      Reflect on how texts have shaped their personal identity and how it can shape those of students and patrons
      Develop an understanding of why and how to think critically about text choices
      Brainstorm strategies for bringing these practices into their local contexts and workplaces

      Bring your hard drives. Bring your laptops. Bring your Dropbox password. We’re going to preserve your podcast. Zines will be provided.
      If you’ve listened to our podcast or read our zine, you know that podcasts are disappearing. So how can podcasters protect themselves against loss? By attending our Preserve This Podcast workshop. This interactive workshop will tackle this issue head-on by walking audio-creators through the history of podcast technology, the basics of archival preservation, and simple steps you can take to preserve your audio. We will review through the tools and techniques to prevent data loss before it’s too late, as well as “bake” these concepts into podcasters’ existing production workflows.
      Co-organized with PRX Podcast Garage.

      Data, Data, Everywhere: Why Tech Giants Collect Your Data and How To Stop Them
      Many of us use digital technology nearly every waking hour of our day. And we’re not alone: studies show that the typical American adult looks at screens for an average of eleven hours a day…. and counting.
      The eleven hours spent with our devices produce a steady stream of personal data that can be utilized by tech giants to influence our behavior. More pressingly, our accumulated data can be used against us in the event of, for example, a successful phishing attempt or a data breach.
      This workshop will provide a gentle introduction to how the internet works so that we can identify how and why our information is collected, with and without our knowledge. We’ll take a tour of the online information flow, discuss the ways in which our information is used, and describe how even our smallest actions -- like which posts we stop to read and which links we click -- amount to data so valuable that internet companies will do almost anything to keep our attention.
      We’ll describe the ways in which we can reduce the impact of all of this exposure. And since this goes beyond us as individuals, we will discuss the ways in which our patrons are exposed to these same issues. We’ll develop creative solutions for what we can do to help.
      By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a better sense of the data that’s being collected about you, why it is being collected, and what we can do to protect ourselves and our patrons from relentless surveillance.
      About the facilitatorDavis Erin Anderson's work focuses on understanding the impact of technology on culture at large, translating these challenges into real solutions for library staff. She is project lead for NYC Digital Safety, an NYC-funded program that keeps library staff informed about evergreen topics in data privacy and digital security.
      Davis worked with Mozilla Foundation to review and update their web literacy curriculum, resulting in the launch of Mozilla’s Core Curriculum for Web Literacy in March 2018. In addition to planning and emceeing METRO’s symposia series, Davis has designed and facilitated workshops on data privacy & security, web mechanics, and personal networking skills for library staff.
