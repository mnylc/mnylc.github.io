METRO has developed and maintains resource sharing services among our member libraries. Our resource sharing services open the world of knowledge to patrons of our member libraries by providing access to collections around New York City and Westchester County.

We facilitate resource sharing through our Referral Card Program and our Delivery Program. Read on for more.

## Referral System
The METRO Referral system makes it easier for students and researchers to locate materials or research onsite at METRO member libraries.
Patrons are able to search for a specific book, item, or across subject areas. To participate in this service, library users should:

  1. Verify that the desired title or collection is not available in your library or in the public library system
  2. Confirm in the [METRO Member Directory]({{ "https://airtable.com/embed/shrQgPlvIJuPzL6mB/tblKD2tRsAUgrsIjp?blocks=hide" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) that the library you are a member of is a METRO Referrals program participant
  3. If you wish to research or study across a subject area, locate a host library that has a strong collection in your subject area
  4. Identify a library that has the title or collection available using OCLC, WorldCat, Docline, or related resources
  5. Visit your member library and they will fill out the referral form and submit to the host library
  6. Remember: access restrictions may apply

The host library will determine the period and length of time a patron may have access to an item or collection. This service does not give users unlimited access to a library's materials and does not guarantee they will be available at a given time. In most cases, access is limited to the specific item or subject. 

## Delivery Service
METRO maintains next-day, Mon-Fri delivery service among our member libraries. Delivery service ensures that our members can count on
efficient access to items from collections throughout METRO's service area. METRO Delivery is a free membership benefit with the
following restrictions:

Each library must designate a delivery site and a contact person. Additional delivery sites may be arranged at additional cost. There are additional fees for packages over 25 pounds. 

### Site Locations 
Libraries should designate a single on-site location for pick-up and delivery. This location should be staffed to provide signatures for
incoming deliveries and oversee outgoing packages.

### Shipping & Packaging Requirements
A wide variety of materials including books, journals, magazines, copies, CDs, DVDs, or any type of bound material may be shipped through the service. You may not ship equipment or furniture. 

All items must be appropriately wrapped and sealed in tearproof envelopes, sturdy bags, or boxes. The first 25 pounds of each shipment are free. Over 25 pounds, additional weight charges will apply.

### Sending Items
Check the delivery column of our [Member Directory]({{ "https://metro.org/members/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) before shipping. This way you can verify that a receiving institution is a current participant in METRO’s Delivery Service.

### Receiver requirements
A representative of the receiving library must sign for all shipments at the time of delivery. Couriers are unable to leave a package without a receipt signature. 

### Contact Information
To get set up with our Delivery Program or to report any issues, please contact Mark Parson at [mparson@metro.org](mailto:mparson@metro.org), or (212) 228-2320 ext 7121.
