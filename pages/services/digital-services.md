## <a class="anchor" name="dcmny"></a>Hosting Services 

METRO works with our member organizations to develop digital asset management solutions that fit almost any use case. With our baseline solution, all of your digital assets are made available as part of a shared repository called the Digital Culture of Metropolitan New York, or ([DCMNY](http://dcmny.org)). DCMNY currently provides access to dozens of METRO members’ digital collections. In addition, DCMNY is an easy on-ramp to the DPLA, meaning the content is discoverable in this greater national context as well.

METRO uses ([Islandora](https://islandora.ca/)), an open-source software configuration that uses Drupal, Solr, and Fedora. Islandora is designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework. In addition to our baseline solution, we can also design a customized service plan based on your organization’s resources and needs. METRO never writes any proprietary or hidden code, and we always give you full access to your own system.

Please contact us if you have further questions.

## <a class="anchor" name="esdn"></a>Data Services
([Empire State Digital Network](http://search-app-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)) is the first service hub to be created explicitly as a means for sharing New York’s rich digital cultural heritage with the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). The Network will be administered by the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) in collaboration with eight allied regional library councils collectively working as NY3Rs Association.

## <a class="anchor" name="cit"></a>Imaging and Digitization Services
While libraries, archives, and partners such as Internet Archive and Google have digitized and made billions of resources available online over the past decades, there is still a long trail of documents, newsletters, photographs, and other materials in the hands of smaller institutions and community members that are in effect invisible because they are not yet available online.

Concluding its first iteration in October 2016, [Culture in Transit](http://www.mnylc.org/cit/) (CIT), a project of METRO in partnership with Queens Library and Brooklyn Public Library, addressed this issue by taking shared digitization technologies and expertise to libraries, archives, and communities throughout the metropolitan New York area to digitize and share the city’s rich cultural heritage online with the world. This project culminated in a [comprehensive toolkit.](https://mnylc.github.io/cit-toolkit/)

CIT was funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, as part of their Knight News Challenge on Libraries.

## <a class="anchor" name="digi_grants"></a>Digitization Grant Program
In January 2005, METRO launched its Digitization Grant Program as an effort to support digitization projects involving significant collections held by METRO member libraries in New York City and Westchester County. This initiative is supported in part by funds from the New York State Regional Bibliographic Databases Program.

Since that time, METRO has awarded approximately $800,000 in grants to support 76 digital projects.

Please note: Funding for digitization projects is on hold at this time. We are currently working on re-envisioning METRO's Digitization grants to more effectively serve the needs of our members. For more information please contact Anne Karle-Zenith, METRO's Digital Services Manager at [annekz@metro.org](mailto:annekz@metro.org).
